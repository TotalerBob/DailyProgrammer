	description: 'Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article not in parentheses, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually eventually gets you to the Philosophy article. As of May 26, 2011, 94.52% of all articles in Wikipedia lead eventually to the article Philosophy. The rest lead to an article with no wikilinks or with links to pages that do not exist, or get stuck in loops.',
